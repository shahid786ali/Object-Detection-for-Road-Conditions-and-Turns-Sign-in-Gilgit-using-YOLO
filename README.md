# Object-Detection-for-Road-Conditions-and-Turns-Sign-in-Gilgit-using-YOLO
This GitHub repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on developing an object detection model for  identifying various road conditions and turns in images
captured on the roads in Gilgit.
The project leverages the YOLOv5  algorithm and is designed to assist in road safety and navigation in challenging terrain.

Welcome to the Road Condition and Turn Detection Model project repository. This project aims to develop a robust object detection model that can identify different road conditions and turns in images captured on the roads in Gilgit. The model utilizes the YOLOv5 algorithm and has been trained on a diverse dataset.

Project Phases
Data Collection: Diverse road images were collected from Gilgit, covering various road types, conditions, and weather scenarios. At least ten images were gathered per class to ensure dataset diversity.

Data Labeling: The collected dataset was meticulously labeled, distinguishing right turns, left turns, straight roads, and unexpected road conditions such as landslides. Roboflow's annotation tools were instrumental in streamlining this process.

Data Preparation with Roboflow: The labeled dataset was prepared for model training using Roboflow. This step involved converting labels into YOLO-compatible format and generating configuration files.

Model Training with Google Colab: The model was trained using Google Colab, which loaded the prepared dataset through Roboflow's APIs. The goal was to detect and classify turns and unexpected road conditions in images.

Model Evaluation: The YOLOv5 model's performance was assessed using critical metrics such as Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Intersection over Union (IoU). The model was fine-tuned based on the evaluation results to enhance accuracy and robustness.

Documentation: Throughout the project, comprehensive documentation was maintained, including data collection details, annotation techniques, model training procedures, and evaluation results. The documentation also includes code snippets and visualizations.

Resources and Tools
To accomplish this project, the following resources and tools were used:

Data Collection Resources: Diverse road images captured in Gilgit.
Roboflow: Used for data labeling, data preparation, and dataset management.
Google Colab: Utilized for model training.
GitHub: Used for version control and project repository management.
Documentation Tools: A combination of text editors and Markdown for creating project reports.
Conclusion
This project not only provided valuable practical experience in computer vision and deep learning but also highlighted the importance of effective tools like Roboflow and cloud-based platforms like Google Colab. The project successfully delivered a robust YOLOv5-based object detection model for identifying road conditions and turns in Gilgit, addressing road safety concerns in the region.
